\description{
Function to extract haplotypic/SNP/genetic eigenvectors and perform null model-based tests.
}
\details{
HaploVectors and SNPVectors are two complementary functions to extract haplotypic/SNP eigenvectors 
and perform null model-based tests. 

HaploVectors function is based in set of DNA sequences (class "DNAbin" or "haplotype") as used by the 
function \code{\link{haplotype}} and pairwise distances from DNA sequences as used in \code{\link{dist.dna}}. 
SNPVectors function is based in set of individual genotypes (class "genind") as pairwise distances 
between alleles based in \code{\link{propShared}} function.

The function HaploVectors extract haplotypic eigenvectors and perform null model tests. The argument \emph{analysis} 
specify the type of analysis performed. When \emph{analysis} is equal "adonis" the analysis is performed 
in matrix of haplotypic composition (using \code{\link{matrix.p.sig}} function). The argument \emph{formula} 
must be specified, where the left hand side gives the resemblance data, right hand side gives the variables. 
The resemblance data is internally named \emph{p.dist}, thus formula is an expression of the form 
\emph{p.dist ~ predictors}. If \emph{analysis} is equal "glm" it is performed with haplovector 
(using \code{\link{pcps.sig}} function). In this case, the argument \emph{formula} must also be 
specified, where the left hand side gives the vectors used, right hand side gives the variables. The vectors 
are internally named sequentially \emph{haplovector.1}, \emph{haplovector.2}, \emph{haplovector.3} and so on. 
Thus, formula is an expression of the form \emph{haplovector.1 ~ predictors}. 

The function SNPVectors work same way, however extract genetic eigenvectors based in distances between alleles. 
Similarly the argument \emph{analysis} specify the type of analysis performed. When \emph{analysis} is equal 
"adonis" the analysis is performed in matrix of genetic composition and the argument \emph{formula} must be 
specified in the same way the HaploVectors function.  If \emph{analysis} is equal "glm" it is performed 
with SNPvector and the argument \emph{formula} must also be specified. This case the vectors are internally named 
sequentially \emph{SNPvector.1}, \emph{SNPvector.2}, \emph{SNPvector.3} and so on. 
Thus, formula is an expression of the form \emph{SNPvector.1 ~ predictors}. 

A third function, called a GenVectors, is also available. In this case, the matrices of distances 
between individuals can be supplied directly. This function work same way that other two functions, but the vectors 
are internally named sequentially \emph{geneticvector.1}, \emph{geneticvector.2}, \emph{geneticvector.3} and so on.
